I am a 9th cycle Economics student at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú. As I am finishing my studies, I am doing a research thesis on the pedagogical practices in primary education that exacerbate or minimize the performance of children in rural schools in Peru. The purpose is to recognize which are the best methodologies that could be used in our context to benefit the personal and professional growth of children in our country, as well as to increase their possibilities of facing reality inside and outside their communities. Currently, I am working as Assistant Manager at Books R US, which specializes in the personalized sale of educational books to private schools and universities.

## Books R US:
The objective is to provide schools, parents and students with materials that help in the teaching of mathematics, language, reading comprehension, languages (English and French), etc.
